# EpiDynaX ðŸ¦ 

**EpiDynaX** is an experimental research framework for discovering and modelling **epidemic transition dynamics** using modern **machine learning** techniques. This work explores the intersection of **data-driven methods** and **mechanistic modelling** to identify the governing equations behind disease spread.

## Requirements

```
conda create -n epidynax_env python=3.11 -y
conda activate epidynax_env
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
```
Additional dependencies are required for contributing to the package. These dependencies include tools for code formatting and quality checking.

To install these additional dependencies, run the following command from the top-level of the repository:
